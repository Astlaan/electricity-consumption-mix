I want to generate graphs with the electricity source shares for the electricity consumed in Portugal.
The ENTSO-E website, however, doesn't provide doesn't provide consumption values per source. It only provides the generated values per source, per country, ie:

Portugal generation: 
Solar: 100MWh
Wind: 200MWh...

However, the portuguese grid is connected to the spanish one and regularly imports a lot of electricity as well (and sometimes exports). So the electricity generation share per source doesn't match the electricity consumption share per source. I'm looking for a way to get the consumption share per source for Portugal.

I think the workaround we will have to use is:
1) If Portugal is net importing electricity, then its consumption share should be calculated, for each time section, by:
  - Retrieving the national electricity generation per source
  - Retrieving the total net imported electricity amount 
  - For each source type (solar, wind, etc), summing its national generation with (total net import * fraction of generated amount that the given source in Spain)
2) If Portugal is exporting electricity, then its consumption share should match its generation share.
