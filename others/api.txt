ENTSO-E Transparency Platform RESTful API Summary:

General Characteristics:
- RESTful API
- Uses HTTP GET method
- Returns XML documents
- Requires security token for authentication
- Base URL: https://transparency.entsoe.eu/api

Parameters:
- securityToken: mandatory for all queries
- documentType: specifies type of information requested
- processType: specifies market time unit
- in_Domain / out_Domain: EIC codes for areas
- periodStart / periodEnd: UTC time in format YYYYMMDDHHMM

Time Series:
- Each time series has a unique ID
- Contains period with start and end time, resolution, and point elements

Domains:
- Use EIC codes to identify areas
- Some queries require in_Domain and out_Domain

Transmission Domain:
1. Physical Flows:
   - DocumentType: A11
   - Represents the actual electricity flow between two areas
   - Measured at the physical interconnections between areas
   - Can be bidirectional (power can flow in both directions)
   - Reflects real-time grid conditions and follows path of least resistance
   - May differ from commercial exchanges due to loop flows or unplanned flows
   - Parameters: in_Domain, out_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd

2. Netted Exchanges (Netted Flows):
   - DocumentType: A13
   - Represents commercial or contractual exchanges of electricity between areas
   - Based on scheduled or planned transfers agreed upon by market participants
   - Calculated as difference between all scheduled commercial exchanges in both directions
   - Always unidirectional (from one area to another)
   - Does not necessarily reflect the actual physical flow of electricity
   - Parameters: in_Domain, out_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd

3. Net Transfer Capacity:
   - DocumentType: A61
   - Day-ahead NTC between two areas
   - Parameters: in_Domain, out_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd

Note: In the European power grid, physical flows can significantly differ from netted exchanges due to the complex nature of electricity grids and market operations.

Generation Domain:
Actual Generation per Type:
   - DocumentType: A75
   - Shows actual power generation per production type
   - Parameters: in_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd

Error Handling:
- Returns HTTP status codes for errors
- Provides Reason element in response for more details

Rate Limiting:
- Limit of 400 requests per user per minute
- 429 Too Many Requests error if exceeded

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate time ranges to avoid timeouts
- Cache data to reduce API calls
- Handle rate limiting and implement retries
