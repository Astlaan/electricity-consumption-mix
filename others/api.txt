ENTSO-E Transparency Platform RESTful API Summary:

General Characteristics:
- RESTful API
- Uses HTTP GET method
- Returns XML documents
- Requires security token for authentication
- Base URL: https://transparency.entsoe.eu/api

Parameters:
- securityToken: mandatory for all queries
- documentType: specifies type of information requested
- processType: specifies market time unit
- in_Domain / out_Domain: EIC codes for areas
- periodStart / periodEnd: UTC time in format YYYYMMDDHHMM

Time Series:
- Each time series has a unique ID
- Contains period with start and end time, resolution, and point elements

Domains:
- Use EIC codes to identify areas
- Some queries require in_Domain and out_Domain

Query Response:
Also in the response, time is always expressed in UTC. System returns both partially and exactly matching data. Amount of returned data depends on regulation article. For example, a query for one day of a weekly forecast will always return a whole week. Likewise, if the requested time interval in a query for a day-ahead forecast covers the last hours of one day and the first hours of the following day, the response will contain complete data for both days.

For the following regulation articles the query response will contain data for a whole day (or a multiple of days, depending on the length of the requested time interval): 6.1.b, 12.1.b, 12.1.d, 12.1.f, 14.1.c and 14.1.d. For the following regulation articles, the query response will contain data for the requested MTU or BTU period(s): 6.1.a, 12.1.g, 16.1.a, 16.1.b&c, 17.1.d-h and 17.1.j.

When querying for daily, weekly, monthly or yearly data, the time interval in the response corresponds to the day in the timezone for which the transparency platform publishes the data. For example: A query for article 6.1.b Day-ahead load forecast for April 6 2016 in Czech republic will yield a response with a time interval starting at 2016-04-05T22:00Z and ending at 2016-04-06T22:00Z. In general, this is the timezone in which the area or border is physically located, however for articles 12.1.d Day-ahead Prices and 12.1.e Net Positions there are exceptions to this rule due to regional arrangements for capacity allocations.

Minimum Time Unit (MTU):
Portugal: 1 h
Spain/France: 15 mins
Data is returned with the time resolutions stated above
In the case of Transmission between different countries, the biggest common timeframe is used. For example: in the case of Portugal <-> Spain flows, 1h resolution is used, but 15mins in the Spain-France case. 

Transmission Domain:
1. Physical Flows:
   - DocumentType: A11
   - Represents the actual electricity flow between two areas
   - Measured at the physical interconnections between areas
   - Can be bidirectional (power can flow in both directions)
   - Reflects real-time grid conditions and follows path of least resistance
   - May differ from commercial exchanges due to loop flows or unplanned flows
   - Parameters: in_Domain, out_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd
   - Maximum time range: 1 year

2. Netted Exchanges (Netted Flows):
   - DocumentType: A13
   - Represents commercial or contractual exchanges of electricity between areas
   - Based on scheduled or planned transfers agreed upon by market participants
   - Calculated as difference between all scheduled commercial exchanges in both directions
   - Always unidirectional (from one area to another)
   - Does not necessarily reflect the actual physical flow of electricity
   - Parameters: in_Domain, out_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd
   - Maximum time range: 1 day

Note: In the European power grid, physical flows can significantly differ from netted exchanges due to the complex nature of electricity grids and market operations.

Generation Domain:
Actual Generation per Type:
   - DocumentType: A75
   - Shows actual power generation per production type
   - Parameters: in_Domain, periodStart, periodEnd
   - Maximum time range: 1 year

Error Handling:
- Returns HTTP status codes for errors
- Provides Reason element in response for more details

Rate Limiting:
- Limit of 400 requests per user per minute
- 429 Too Many Requests error if exceeded

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate time ranges to avoid timeouts
- Cache data to reduce API calls
- Handle rate limiting and implement retries

Other aspects:
- The data tables are transmitted in XML. Some columns can be omitted if no data was registered. For example: for the aggregated generation by time, in the Portuguese case, the column with the coal-based electrical generation values may be not present for certain date ranges, since recently all the coal stations were decommissioned.
