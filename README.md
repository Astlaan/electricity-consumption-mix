## To-Do:
- Data is provided in MW. I have to calculate by the granularity in order to obtain MWh

## Notes:
- Currently, cross-border physical flows are being accounted for in a net way. It appears that often, net flow matches the physical flows. However, this could be improved in the future to account for the actual physical flows.
